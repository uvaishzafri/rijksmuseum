# Museum Tiles App

## Overview

The Museum Tiles App is a Flutter application designed to showcase detailed information about various artifacts from museums, focusing particularly on tiles. This application features engaging UI elements such as a collapsing toolbar, image carousels, and interactive maps to provide a rich user experience. Users can explore detailed artifact information, including titles, images, production places, and more.

## Features

- **Collapsing Toolbar:** A dynamic and responsive AppBar that adjusts as the user scrolls, featuring the main artifact image.
